# Android Video Compressor

Video Compressor based on the [**Telegram for Android**](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram) [![Telegram for Android](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lalongooo/VideoCompressor/master/images/ic_launcher.png)](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram) app source code.

#### Important:

* This project is based on an older version of the Telegram for Android app. A version from one year ago.
* It is supposed to work on the Android API 17+, however has not been tested properly on Marshmallow and above.
* No major issues have been reported on Lollipop.
* In order to have this project working correctly, it needs to be  updated as the official Telegram for Android app does. No ETA at this time.

#### Quick workaround for issues found on API 17+:
1. Download [Telegram for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger) from Google Play Store.
2. Compress the video you are having issues with.
3. The results are ok? Then, this project needs to be updated. Have issues with the compressed video? Sorry, the problem is with the original code this project is based on. Not much I can do on that.
